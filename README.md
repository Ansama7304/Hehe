🎮 A totally serious, not-at-all chaotic game where things might explode, characters might fall in love, and the code occasionally behaves.

- Multiple endings (including fake ones, because why not)
- Hot spring episode (of course)
- Fully text-based because we believe in the power of imagination™
- AI that may or may not flirt with you
